```
When the day is over
When tomorrow falters before you step
When the courage leaves you
When your spirit burns out again
And again
The mountains and oceans are
Silently watching storms that pass by
Carefully calling a new constellation
That forms before your eyes
Despite the broken pieces
The world must have a reason
For life, For our love
Spread your wings, it’s time to fly unto our fate
And soar the skies, exploring the unknown
No need to fear, this universe that’s full of hope
After all, you are never alone
Take my hand, and feel your worries drift away
We’ll trace the stars, while taking in the sights
There’s a million reasons why you’re here, alive
At the end of the night, waits a sunrise
Lingering in this dream
Holding on to memories afraid to fall
But at the edge of darkness
Our destiny is calling to us
From above
The rivers and valleys are
Eagerly waiting for a new song
Awakening spirits call a melody
From beyond the stars
Trails of light surround us
Determination glows in our eyes
In our hearts
Spread your wings, It’s time to break free of the chains
We’re soaring high, embracing the unknown
It’s crystal clear, our reason for belonging here
You’re the one that the world calls it’s own
Trust in me, I know that it’s so hard to make sense
Of the life bestowed onto our name
The harmony, it’s ringing out eternally
Cause I want you to see the beauty
Outside this dream
No hesitation,
Unlock the cage and set it free
Let’s fly away,
Into this brave new world…
All the birds they sing in tune
“We’re gonna make it through I promise you”
And with hope by our side nothing is impossible
With our hope, dreams, wings
We are flying into the sun
